# ===============================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# ===============================================
# NOTE: Frontend environment is controlled by Vite's MODE
# - Development: npm run dev (MODE=development)
# - Production: npm run build (MODE=production)
#
# URLs are automatically configured based on MODE in:
# /src/config/environment.js
#
# You can override the development API URL here if needed:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3007
#
# For production builds, the API URL is hardcoded to:
# https://api.uribarri.online
